# British-Airways-Customer-Review-Analysis

## Overview
This Python script is written to collect customer feedback through data scraping and to understand customers' needs and opinions about BA through data analysis. Customer review data is obtained from a third party source, Skytrax. The data is analysed using topic modelling methods, including NMF and LDA. Sentiment analysis was carried out using VADER and a word cloud was generated. Customer review data is essential for understanding the general customer experience and what customers values, so that BA can improve on those qualities to provide better customer experience.

This project is the first task of the British Airways Data Science virtual experience programme.

## Report
A high-level slide deck summarising the analysis can be found in the Reports folder.
